/**
 * ABC Problem
 * 
 * You are given a collection of ABC blocks (e.g., childhood alphabet blocks). 
 * There are 20 blocks with two letters on each block. 
 * A complete alphabet is guaranteed amongst all sides of the blocks. 
 * The sample collection of blocks:
 * 
    (B O)
    (X K)
    (D Q)
    (C P)
    (N A)
    (G T)
    (R E)
    (T G)
    (Q D)
    (F S)
    (J W)
    (H U)
    (V I)
    (A N)
    (O B)
    (E R)
    (F S)
    (L Y)
    (P C)
    (Z M)

 * Implement a function that takes a string (word) and determines 
    whether the word can be spelled with the given collection of blocks.

    * Some rules to keep in mind:
        Once a letter on a block is used, that block cannot be used again.
        The function should be case-insensitive.
